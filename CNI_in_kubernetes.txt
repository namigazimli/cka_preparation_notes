CNI defines the responsibilities of container runtime. As per CNI, container runtimes is responsible for creating container network namespaces. Identifying and attaching those namespaces to the right network by calling the right network plugin. Where do we specify the CNI plugins for Kubernetes to use? The CNI plugin must be invoked by the component within Kubernetes that is responsible for creating containers. Because that component must then invoke the appropriate network plugin after the container is created. The CNI plugin is configured in the kubelet service on each node in the cluster.
