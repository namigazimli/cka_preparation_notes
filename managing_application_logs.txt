We create a pod with the event simulator Docker image using the pod definition file.

----------------------------------------
event-simulator.yaml                   |
----------------------------------------
apiVersion: v1                         |
kind: Pod                              |
metadata:                              |
  name: event-simulator-pod            |
spec:                                  |
  containers:                          |
    - name: event-simulator            |
      image: kodekloud/event-simulator |
----------------------------------------

--> kubectl create -f event-simulator.yaml

Once it's the pod is running, we can view the logs using the "kubectl logs" command 
with the pod name.

--> kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod

Use the -f option to stream the logs live. Now these logs are specific to the container
running inside the pod. We know that Kubernetes Pods can have multiple containers in them.
In this case we modify the pod definition file to include an additional container called
image-processor.

----------------------------------------
event-simulator.yaml                   |
----------------------------------------
apiVersion: v1                         |
kind: Pod                              |
metadata:                              |
  name: event-simulator-pod            |
spec:                                  |
  containers:                          |
    - name: event-simulator            |
      image: kodekloud/event-simulator |
    - name: image-processor            |           
      image: some-image-processor      |
----------------------------------------

If we ran kubectl logs command again, which container's log would it show? If there are multiple 
containers within a pod, you must specify the name of the container explicitly in the command.
Otherwise it would fail asking you to specify a name. In this case we will specify the name of
the first container "event-simulator" and that prints the relevant log messages.

--> kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod event-simulator

Now that is the simple logging functionality implemented within Kubernetes.
